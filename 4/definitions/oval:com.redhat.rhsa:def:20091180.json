		"description": "The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain\nName System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver\nlibrary (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and\ntools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.\n\nA flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message packets\ncontaining the \"ANY\" record type. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\nsend a specially-crafted dynamic update packet that could cause named to\nexit with an assertion failure. (CVE-2009-0696)\n\nNote: even if named is not configured for dynamic updates, receiving such\na specially-crafted dynamic update packet could still cause named to exit\nunexpectedly.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* when running on a system receiving a large number of (greater than 4,000)\nDNS requests per second, the named DNS nameserver became unresponsive, and\nthe named service had to be restarted in order for it to continue serving\nrequests. This was caused by a deadlock occurring between two threads that\nled to the inability of named to continue to service requests. This\ndeadlock has been resolved with these updated packages so that named no\nlonger becomes unresponsive under heavy load. (BZ#512668)\n\nAll BIND users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the\nupdate, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted automatically.",
