    "description": "GDB, the GNU debugger, allows debugging of programs written in C, C++, and\nother languages by executing them in a controlled fashion and then printing\ntheir data.\n\nVarious buffer overflows and underflows were found in the DWARF expression\ncomputation stack in GDB. If a user loaded an executable containing\nmalicious debugging information into GDB, an attacker might be able to\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. (CVE-2006-4146)\n\nThis updated package also addresses the following issues:\n\n* Fixed bogus 0x0 unwind of the thread's topmost function clone(3).\n\n* Fixed deadlock accessing invalid address; for corrupted backtraces.\n\n* Fixed a race which occasionally left the detached processes stopped.\n\n* Fixed 'gcore' command for 32bit debugged processes on 64bit hosts.\n\n* Added support for TLS 'errno' for threaded programs missing its '-debuginfo' package..\n\n* Suggest TLS 'errno' resolving by hand if no threading was found..\n\n* Added a fix to prevent stepping into asynchronously invoked signal handlers.\n\n* Added a fix to avoid false warning on shared objects bfd close on Itanium.\n\n* Fixed segmentation fault on the source display by ^X 1.\n\n* Fixed object names keyboard completion.\n\n* Added a fix to avoid crash of 'info threads' if stale threads exist.\n\n* Fixed a bug where shared libraries occasionally failed to load .\n\n* Fixed handling of exec() called by a threaded debugged program.\n\n* Fixed rebuilding requirements of the gdb package itself on multilib systems.\n\n* Fixed source directory pathname detection for the edit command.\n\nAll users of gdb should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.",
