		"description": "The glibc packages contain the standard C libraries used by multiple\nprograms on the system. These packages contain the standard C and the\nstandard math libraries. Without these two libraries, a Linux system cannot\nfunction properly.\n\nAn integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was\nfound in the way the glibc library read timezone files. If a\ncarefully-crafted timezone file was loaded by an application linked against\nglibc, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.\n(CVE-2009-5029)\n\nA flaw was found in the way the ldd utility identified dynamically linked\nlibraries. If an attacker could trick a user into running ldd on a\nmalicious binary, it could result in arbitrary code execution with the\nprivileges of the user running ldd. (CVE-2009-5064)\n\nIt was discovered that the glibc addmntent() function, used by various\nmount helper utilities, did not sanitize its input properly. A local\nattacker could possibly use this flaw to inject malformed lines into the\nmtab (mounted file systems table) file via certain setuid mount helpers, if\nthe attacker were allowed to mount to an arbitrary directory under their\ncontrol. (CVE-2010-0296)\n\nAn integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was\nfound in the way the glibc library loaded ELF (Executable and Linking\nFormat) files. If a carefully-crafted ELF file was loaded by an\napplication linked against glibc, it could cause the application to crash\nor, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user\nrunning the application. (CVE-2010-0830)\n\nIt was discovered that the glibc fnmatch() function did not properly\nrestrict the use of alloca(). If the function was called on sufficiently\nlarge inputs, it could cause an application using fnmatch() to crash or,\npossibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.\n(CVE-2011-1071)\n\nIt was found that the glibc addmntent() function, used by various mount\nhelper utilities, did not handle certain errors correctly when updating the\nmtab (mounted file systems table) file. If such utilities had the setuid\nbit set, a local attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the mtab file.\n(CVE-2011-1089)\n\nIt was discovered that the locale command did not produce properly escaped\noutput as required by the POSIX specification. If an attacker were able to\nset the locale environment variables in the environment of a script that\nperformed shell evaluation on the output of the locale command, and that\nscript were run with different privileges than the attacker's, it could\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the script. (CVE-2011-1095)\n\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in the glibc fnmatch() function. If an\nattacker supplied a long UTF-8 string to an application linked against\nglibc, it could cause the application to crash. (CVE-2011-1659)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the remote procedure call (RPC)\nimplementation in glibc. A remote attacker able to open a large number of\nconnections to an RPC service that is using the RPC implementation from\nglibc, could use this flaw to make that service use an excessive amount of\nCPU time. (CVE-2011-4609)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Ubuntu Security Team for reporting\nCVE-2010-0830, and Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2011-1089. The Ubuntu\nSecurity Team acknowledges Dan Rosenberg as the original reporter of\nCVE-2010-0830.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* When using an nscd package that is a different version than the glibc\npackage, the nscd service could fail to start. This update makes the nscd\npackage require a specific glibc version to prevent this problem.\n(BZ#657009)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these issues.",
