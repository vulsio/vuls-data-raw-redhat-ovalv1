		"description": "Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.\n\nTwo flaws were found in the way Firefox processed certain regular\nexpressions.  A malicious web page could crash the browser or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.  (CVE-2006-4565,\nCVE-2006-4566)\n\nA number of flaws were found in Firefox.  A malicious web page could crash\nthe browser or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.\n (CVE-2006-4571)\n\nA flaw was found in the handling of Javascript timed events.  A malicious\nweb page could crash the browser or possibly execute arbitrary code as the\nuser running Firefox. (CVE-2006-4253)\n\nDaniel Bleichenbacher recently described an implementation error in RSA\nsignature verification.  For RSA keys with exponent 3 it is possible for an\nattacker to forge a signature that would be incorrectly verified by the NSS\nlibrary. Firefox as shipped trusts several root Certificate Authorities\nthat use exponent 3.  An attacker could have created a carefully crafted\nSSL certificate which be incorrectly trusted when their site was visited by\na victim. (CVE-2006-4340)\n\nA flaw was found in the Firefox auto-update verification system.  An\nattacker who has the ability to spoof a victim's DNS could get Firefox to\ndownload and install malicious code. In order to exploit this issue an\nattacker would also need to get a victim to previously accept an\nunverifiable certificate. (CVE-2006-4567)\n\nFirefox did not properly prevent a frame in one domain from injecting\ncontent into a sub-frame that belongs to another domain, which facilitates\nwebsite spoofing and other attacks (CVE-2006-4568)\n\nFirefox did not load manually opened, blocked popups in the right domain\ncontext, which could lead to cross-site scripting attacks.  In order to\nexploit this issue an attacker would need to find a site which would frame\ntheir malicious page and convince the user to manually open a blocked\npopup. (CVE-2006-4569)\n\nUsers of Firefox are advised to upgrade to this update, which contains\nFirefox version 1.5.0.7 that corrects these issues.",
