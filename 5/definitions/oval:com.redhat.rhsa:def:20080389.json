    "description": "The nss_ldap package contains the nss_ldap and pam_ldap modules. The\nnss_ldap module is a plug-in which allows applications to retrieve\ninformation about users and groups from a directory server. The pam_ldap\nmodule allows PAM-aware applications to use a directory server to verify\nuser passwords.\n\nA race condition was discovered in nss_ldap which affected certain\napplications which make LDAP connections, such as Dovecot. This could cause\nnss_ldap to answer a request for information about one user with\ninformation about a different user. (CVE-2007-5794)\n\nIn addition, these updated packages fix the following bugs:\n\n* a build error prevented the nss_ldap module from being able to use DNS to\ndiscover the location of a directory server. For example, when the\n/etc/nsswitch.conf configuration file was configured to use \"ldap\", but no\n\"host\" or \"uri\" option was configured in the /etc/ldap.conf configuration\nfile, no directory server was contacted, and no results were returned.\n\n* the \"port\" option in the /etc/ldap.conf configuration file on client\nmachines was ignored. For example, if a directory server which you were\nattempting to use was listening on a non-default port (i.e. not ports 389\nor 636), it was only possible to use that directory server by including the\nport number in the \"uri\" option. In this updated package, the \"port\" option\nworks as expected.\n\n* pam_ldap failed to change an expired password if it had to follow a\nreferral to do so, which could occur, for example, when using a slave\ndirectory server in a replicated environment. An error such as the\nfollowing occurred after entering a new password: \"LDAP password\ninformation update failed: Can't contact LDAP server Insufficient 'write'\nprivilege to the 'userPassword' attribute\"\n\nThis has been resolved in this updated package.\n\n* when the \"pam_password exop_send_old\" password-change method was\nconfigured in the /etc/ldap.conf configuration file, a logic error in the\npam_ldap module caused client machines to attempt to change a user's\npassword twice. First, the pam_ldap module attempted to change the password\nusing the \"exop\" request, and then again using an LDAP modify request.\n\n* on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.1, rebuilding nss_ldap-253-5.el5 when the\nkrb5-*-1.6.1-17.el5 packages were installed failed due to an error such as\nthe following:\n\n\t+ /builddir/build/SOURCES/dlopen.sh ./nss_ldap-253/nss_ldap.so\n\tdlopen() of \"././nss_ldap-253/nss_ldap.so\" failed:\n\t./././nss_ldap-253/nss_ldap.so: undefined symbol: request_key\n\terror: Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.62652 (%build)\n\nThe missing libraries have been added, which resolves this issue.\n\nWhen recursively enumerating the set of members in a given group, the\nmodule would allocate insufficient space for storing the set of member\nnames if the group itself contained other groups, thus corrupting the heap.\nThis update includes a backported fix for this bug.\n\nUsers of nss_ldap should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct this issue and fix these bugs.",
