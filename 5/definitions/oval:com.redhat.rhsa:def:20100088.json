		"description": "KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for\nLinux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for\nthe standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.\n\nThe x86 emulator implementation was missing a check for the Current\nPrivilege Level (CPL) and I/O Privilege Level (IOPL). A user in a guest\ncould leverage these flaws to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or\npossibly escalate their privileges within that guest. (CVE-2010-0298,\nCVE-2010-0306)\n\nA flaw was found in the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) emulation. Access\nto the internal data structure pit_state, which represents the data state\nof the emulated PIT, was not properly validated in the pit_ioport_read()\nfunction. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.\n(CVE-2010-0309)\n\nA flaw was found in the USB passthrough handling code. A specially-crafted\nUSB packet sent from inside a guest could be used to trigger a buffer\noverflow in the usb_host_handle_control() function, which runs under the\nQEMU-KVM context on the host. A user in a guest could leverage this flaw to\ncause a denial of service (guest hang or crash) or possibly escalate their\nprivileges within the host. (CVE-2010-0297)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs: \n\n* pvclock MSR values were not preserved during remote migration, causing\ntime drift for guests. (BZ#537028)\n\n* SMBIOS table 4 data is now generated for Windows guests. (BZ#545874)\n\n* if the qemu-kvm \"-net user\" option was used, unattended Windows XP\ninstallations did not receive an IP address after reboot. (BZ#546562)\n\n* when being restored from migration, a race condition caused Windows\nServer 2008 R2 guests to hang during shutdown. (BZ#546563)\n\n* the kernel symbol checking on the kvm-kmod build process has a safety\ncheck for ABI changes. (BZ#547293)\n\n* on hosts without high-res timers, Windows Server 2003 guests experienced\nsignificant time drift. (BZ#547625)\n\n* in some situations, installing Windows Server 2008 R2 from an ISO image\nresulted in a blue screen \"BAD_POOL_HEADER\" stop error. (BZ#548368)\n\n* a bug in the grow_refcount_table() error handling caused infinite\nrecursion in some cases. This caused the qemu-kvm process to hang and\neventually crash. (BZ#552159)\n\n* for Windows Server 2003 R2, Service Pack 2, 32-bit guests, an \"unhandled\nvm exit\" error could occur during reboot on some systems. (BZ#552518)\n\n* for Windows guests, QEMU could attempt to stop a stopped audio device,\nresulting in a \"snd_playback_stop: ASSERT playback_channel->base.active\nfailed\" error. (BZ#552519)\n\n* the Hypercall driver did not reset the device on power-down. (BZ#552528)\n\n* mechanisms have been added to make older savevm versions to be emitted in\nsome cases. (BZ#552529)\n\n* an error in the Makefile prevented users from using the source RPM to\ninstall KVM. (BZ#552530)\n\n* guests became unresponsive and could use up to 100% CPU when running\ncertain benchmark tests with more than 7 guests running simultaneously.\n(BZ#553249)\n\n* QEMU could terminate randomly with virtio-net and SMP enabled.\n(BZ#561022)\n\nAll KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues. Note: The procedure in the\nSolution section must be performed before this update will take effect.",
