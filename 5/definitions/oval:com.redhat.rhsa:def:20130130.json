    "description": "The httpd packages contain the Apache HTTP Server (httpd), which is the\nnamesake project of The Apache Software Foundation.\n\nInput sanitization flaws were found in the mod_negotiation module. A remote\nattacker able to upload or create files with arbitrary names in a directory\nthat has the MultiViews options enabled, could use these flaws to conduct\ncross-site scripting and HTTP response splitting attacks against users\nvisiting the site. (CVE-2008-0455, CVE-2008-0456, CVE-2012-2687)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* Previously, no check was made to see if the\n/etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key file was a valid key prior to running\nthe \"%post\" script for the \"mod_ssl\" package. Consequently, when\n/etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt did not exist and \"localhost.key\" was\npresent but invalid, upgrading the Apache HTTP Server daemon (httpd) with\nmod_ssl failed. The \"%post\" script has been fixed to test for an existing\nSSL key. As a result, upgrading httpd with mod_ssl now proceeds as\nexpected. (BZ#752618)\n\n* The \"mod_ssl\" module did not support operation under FIPS mode.\nConsequently, when operating Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 with FIPS mode\nenabled, httpd failed to start. An upstream patch has been applied to\ndisable non-FIPS functionality if operating under FIPS mode and httpd now\nstarts as expected. (BZ#773473)\n\n* Prior to this update, httpd exit status codes were not Linux Standard\nBase (LSB) compliant. When the command \"service httpd reload\" was run and\nhttpd failed, the exit status code returned was \"0\" and not in the range 1\nto 6 as expected. A patch has been applied to the init script and httpd now\nreturns \"1\" as an exit status code. (BZ#783242)\n\n* Chunked Transfer Coding is described in RFC 2616. Previously, the\nApache server did not correctly handle a chunked encoded POST request with\na \"chunk-size\" or \"chunk-extension\" value of 32 bytes or more.\nConsequently, when such a POST request was made the server did not respond.\nAn upstream patch has been applied and the problem no longer occurs.\n(BZ#840845)\n\n* Due to a regression, when mod_cache received a non-cacheable 304\nresponse, the headers were served incorrectly. Consequently, compressed\ndata could be returned to the client without the cached headers to indicate\nthe data was compressed. An upstream patch has been applied to merge\nresponse and cached headers before data from the cache is served to the\nclient. As a result, cached data is now correctly interpreted by the\nclient. (BZ#845532)\n\n* In a proxy configuration, certain response-line strings were not handled\ncorrectly. If a response-line without a \"description\" string was received\nfrom the origin server, for a non-standard status code, such as the \"450\"\nstatus code, a \"500 Internal Server Error\" would be returned to the client.\nThis bug has been fixed so that the original response line is returned to\nthe client. (BZ#853128)\n\nEnhancements:\n\n* The configuration directive \"LDAPReferrals\" is now supported in addition\nto the previously introduced \"LDAPChaseReferrals\". (BZ#727342)\n\n* The AJP support module for \"mod_proxy\", \"mod_proxy_ajp\", now supports the\n\"ProxyErrorOverride\" directive. Consequently, it is now possible to\nconfigure customized error pages for web applications running on a backend\nserver accessed via AJP. (BZ#767890)\n\n* The \"%posttrans\" scriptlet which automatically restarts the httpd service\nafter a package upgrade can now be disabled. If the file\n/etc/sysconfig/httpd-disable-posttrans exists, the scriptlet will not\nrestart the daemon. (BZ#833042)\n\n* The output of \"httpd -S\" now includes configured alias names for each\nvirtual host. (BZ#833043)\n\n* New certificate variable names are now exposed by \"mod_ssl\" using the\n\"_DN_userID\" suffix, such as \"SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_userID\", which use the\ncommonly used object identifier (OID) definition of \"userID\", OID\n0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1. (BZ#840036)\n\nAll users of httpd are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\nfix these issues and add these enhancements.",
