    "description": "The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the\nvirtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems. In\naddition, libvirt provides tools for remote management of virtualized\nsystems.\n\nBus and device IDs were ignored when attempting to attach multiple USB\ndevices with identical vendor or product IDs to a guest. This could result\nin the wrong device being attached to a guest, giving that guest root\naccess to the device. (CVE-2012-2693)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the libvirtd library failed to set the autostart flags for\nalready defined QEMU domains. This bug has been fixed, and the domains can\nnow be successfully marked as autostarted. (BZ#675319)\n\n* Prior to this update, the virFileAbsPath() function was not taking into\naccount the slash (\"/\") directory separator when allocating memory for\ncombining the cwd() function and a path. This behavior could lead to a\nmemory corruption. With this update, a transformation to the virAsprintff()\nfunction has been introduced into virFileAbsPath(). As a result, the\naforementioned behavior no longer occurs. (BZ#680289)\n\n* With this update, a man page of the virsh user interface has been\nenhanced with information on the \"domxml-from-native\" and\n\"domxml-to-native\" commands. A correct notation of the format argument has\nbeen clarified. As a result, confusion is avoided when setting the format\nargument in the described commands. (BZ#783001)\n\nAll users of libvirt are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing\nthe updated packages, libvirtd will be restarted automatically.",
