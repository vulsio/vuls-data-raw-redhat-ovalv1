		"description": "The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give\ncertain users the ability to run commands as root.\n\nA flaw was found in the sudo password checking logic. In configurations\nwhere the sudoers settings allowed a user to run a command using sudo\nwith only the group ID changed, sudo failed to prompt for the user's\npassword before running the specified command with the elevated group\nprivileges. (CVE-2011-0010)\n\nIn addition, this update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* A NULL pointer dereference bug caused the sudo utility to terminate\nunexpectedly with a segmentation fault. This happened if the utility was\nrun with the -g option and configured not to demand the password from the\nuser who ran the sudo utility. With this update, the code has been modified\nand the problem no longer occurs. (BZ#673072)\n\n* The sudo utility failed to load sudoers from an LDAP (Lightweight\nDirectory Access Protocol) server after the sudo tool was upgraded. This\nhappened because the upgraded nsswitch.conf file did not contain the\ninstruction to search for sudoers on the LDAP server. This update adds the\nlost instruction to /etc/nsswitch.conf and the system searches for sources\nof sudoers on the local file system and then on LDAP, if applicable.\n(BZ#617061)\n\n* The sudo tool interpreted a Runas alias specifying a group incorrectly as\na user alias and the alias seemed to be ignored. With this update, the code\nfor interpreting such aliases has been modified and the Runas group aliases\nare honored as expected. (BZ#627543)\n\n* Prior to this update, sudo did not parse comment characters (#) in the\nldap.conf file correctly and could fail to work. With this update, parsing\nof the LDAP configuration file has been modified and the comment characters\nare parsed correctly. (BZ#750318)\n\n* The sudo utility formats its output to fit the width of the terminal\nwindow. However, this behavior is undesirable if the output is redirected\nthrough a pipeline. With this update, the output formatting is not applied\nin the scenario described. (BZ#697111)\n\n* Previously, the sudo utility performed Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)\nrelated initialization after switching to an unprivileged user. This\nprevented the correct setup of the SELinux environment before executing the\nspecified command and could potentially cause an access denial. The bug has\nbeen fixed by backporting the SELinux related code and the execution model\nfrom a newer version of sudo. (BZ#477185)\n\n* On execv(3) function failure, the sudo tool executed an auditing call\nbefore reporting the failure. The call reset the error state and,\nconsequently, the tool incorrectly reported that the command succeeded.\nWith this update, the code has been modified and the problem no longer\noccurs. (BZ#673157)\n\nAll users of sudo are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\nresolves these issues.",
