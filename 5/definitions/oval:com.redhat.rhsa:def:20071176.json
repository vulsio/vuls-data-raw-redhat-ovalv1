    "description": "The autofs utility controls the operation of the automount daemon, which\nautomatically mounts file systems when you use them, and unmounts them when\nyou are not using them. This can include network file systems and CD-ROMs.\n\nThere was a security issue with the default configuration of autofs version\n5, whereby the entry for the \"-hosts\" map did not specify the \"nodev\" mount\noption. A local user with control of a remote NFS server could create\nspecial device files on the remote file system, that if mounted using the\ndefault \"-hosts\" map, could allow the user to access important system\ndevices. (CVE-2007-6285)\n\nThis issue is similar to CVE-2007-5964, which fixed a missing \"nosuid\"\nmount option in autofs. Both the \"nodev\" and \"nosuid\" options should be\nenabled to prevent a possible compromise of machine integrity.\n\nDue to the fact that autofs always mounted \"-hosts\" map entries \"dev\" by\ndefault, autofs has now been altered to always use the \"nodev\" option when\nmounting from the default \"-hosts\" map. The \"dev\" option must be explicitly\ngiven in the master map entry to revert to the old behavior. This change\naffects only the \"-hosts\" map which corresponds to the \"/net\" entry in the\ndefault configuration.\n\nAll autofs users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve this issue.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Tim Baum for reporting this issue.",
