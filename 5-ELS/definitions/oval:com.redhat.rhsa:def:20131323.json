		"description": "Chip/Smart Card Interface Devices (CCID) is a USB smart card reader\nstandard followed by most modern smart card readers. The ccid package\nprovides a Generic, USB-based CCID driver for readers, which follow this\nstandard.\n\nAn integer overflow, leading to an array index error, was found in the way\nthe CCID driver processed a smart card's serial number. A local attacker\ncould use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser running the PC/SC Lite pcscd daemon (root, by default), by inserting a\nspecially-crafted smart card. (CVE-2010-4530)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* The pcscd service failed to read from the SafeNet Smart Card 650 v1 when\nit was inserted into a smart card reader. The operation failed with a\n\"IFDHPowerICC() PowerUp failed\" error message. This was due to the card\ntaking a long time to respond with a full Answer To Reset (ATR) request,\nwhich lead to a timeout, causing the card to fail to power up. This update\nincreases the timeout value so that the aforementioned request is processed\nproperly, and the card is powered on as expected. (BZ#907821)\n\nAll ccid users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues.",
