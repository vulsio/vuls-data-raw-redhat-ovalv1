		"description": "The gnome-vfs2 packages provide the GNOME Virtual File System, which is the\nfoundation of the Nautilus file manager. neon is an HTTP and WebDAV client\nlibrary embedded in the gnome-vfs2 packages.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the neon Extensible Markup Language\n(XML) parser. Visiting a malicious DAV server with an application using\ngnome-vfs2 (such as Nautilus) could possibly cause the application to\nconsume an excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2009-2473)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* When extracted from the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), gnome-vfs2\nreturned escaped file paths. If a path, as stored in the URI,\ncontained non-ASCII characters or ASCII characters which are parsed as\nsomething other than a file path (for example, spaces), the escaped path\nwas inaccurate. Consequently, files with the described type of URI could\nnot be processed. With this update, gnome-vfs2 properly unescapes paths\nthat are required for a system call. As a result, these paths are parsed\nproperly. (BZ#580855)\n\n* In certain cases, the trash info file was populated by foreign\nentries, pointing to live data. Emptying the trash caused an accidental\ndeletion of valuable data. With this update, a workaround has been applied\nin order to prevent the deletion. As a result, the accidental data loss is\nprevented, however further information is still gathered to fully fix this\nproblem. (BZ#586015)\n\n* Due to a wrong test checking for a destination file system, the Nautilus\nfile manager failed to delete a symbolic link to a folder which was\nresiding in another file system. With this update, a special test has been\nadded. As a result, a symbolic link pointing to another file system can be\ntrashed or deleted properly. (BZ#621394)\n\n* Prior to this update, when directories without a read permission were\nmarked for copy, the Nautilus file manager skipped these unreadable\ndirectories without notification. With this update, Nautilus displays an\nerror message and properly informs the user about the aforementioned\nproblem. (BZ#772307)\n\n* Previously, gnome-vfs2 used the stat() function calls for every file on\nthe MultiVersion File System (MVFS), used for example by IBM Rational\nClearCase. This behavior significantly slowed down file operations. With\nthis update, the unnecessary stat() operations have been limited. As a\nresult, gnome-vfs2 user interfaces, such as Nautilus, are more responsive.\n(BZ#822817)\n\nAll gnome-vfs2 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues.",
