		"description": "The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer\nfor UNIX(R) operating systems.\n\nA flaw was found in the way CUPS handles certain Internet Printing Protocol\n(IPP) tags. A remote attacker who is able to connect to the IPP TCP port\ncould send a malicious request causing the CUPS daemon to crash, or\npotentially execute arbitrary code. Please note that the default CUPS\nconfiguration does not allow remote hosts to connect to the IPP TCP port.\n(CVE-2007-4351)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Alin Rad Pop for reporting this issue.\n\nAll CUPS users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to resolve this issue.\n\nIn addition, the following bugs were fixed:\n\n* the CUPS service has been changed to start after sshd, to avoid causing\ndelays when logging in when the system is booted.\n\n* the logrotate settings have been adjusted so they do not cause CUPS to\nreload its configuration. This is to avoid re-printing the current job,\nwhich could occur when it was a long-running job.\n\n* a bug has been fixed in the handling of the If-Modified-Since: HTTP\nheader.\n\n* in the LSPP configuration, labels for labeled jobs did not line-wrap.\nThis has been fixed.\n\n* an access check in the LSPP configuration has been made more secure.\n\n* the cups-lpd service no longer ignores the \"-odocument-format=...\"\noption.\n\n* a memory allocation bug has been fixed in cupsd.\n\n* support for UNIX domain sockets authentication without passwords has been\nadded.\n\n* in the LSPP configuration, a problem that could lead to cupsd crashing\nhas been fixed.\n\n* the error handling in the initscript has been improved.\n\n* The job-originating-host-name attribute was not correctly set for jobs\nsubmitted via the cups-lpd service. This has been fixed.\n\n* a problem with parsing IPv6 addresses in the configuration file has been\nfixed.\n\n* a problem that could lead to cupsd crashing when it failed to open a\n\"file:\" URI has been fixed.",
