    "description": "The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain\nName System (DNS) protocols. It contains a DNS server (named), a resolver\nlibrary with routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS,\nand tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.\nThese packages contain version 9.7 of the BIND suite.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND handled queries for\nNSEC3-signed zones. A remote attacker could use this flaw against an\nauthoritative name server that served NCES3-signed zones by sending a\nspecially crafted query, which, when processed, would cause named to crash.\n(CVE-2014-0591)\n\nNote: The CVE-2014-0591 issue does not directly affect the version of\nbind97 shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. This issue is being addressed\nhowever to assure it is not introduced in future builds of bind97 (possibly\nbuilt with a different compiler or C library optimization).\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* Previously, the bind97 initscript did not check for the existence of the\nROOTDIR variable when shutting down the named daemon. As a consequence,\nsome parts of the file system that are mounted when using bind97 in a\nchroot environment were unmounted on daemon shut down, even if bind97 was\nnot running in a chroot environment. With this update, the initscript has\nbeen fixed to check for the existence of the ROOTDIR variable when\nunmounting some parts of the file system on named daemon shut down. Now,\nwhen shutting down bind97 that is not running in a chroot environment, no\nparts of the file system are unmounted. (BZ#1059118)\n\nAll bind97 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the\nupdate, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted automatically.",
