		"description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThese updated packages fix the following security issues:\n\n* a possible kernel memory leak was found in the Linux kernel Simple\nInternet Transition (SIT) INET6 implementation. This could allow a local\nunprivileged user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2008-2136, Important)\n\n* a flaw was found in the Linux kernel setrlimit system call, when setting\nRLIMIT_CPU to a certain value. This could allow a local unprivileged user\nto bypass the CPU time limit. (CVE-2008-1294, Moderate)\n\n* multiple NULL pointer dereferences were found in various Linux kernel\nnetwork drivers. These drivers were missing checks for terminal validity,\nwhich could allow privilege escalation. (CVE-2008-2812, Moderate)\n\nThese updated packages fix the following bugs:\n\n* the GNU libc stub resolver is a minimal resolver that works with Domain\nName System (DNS) servers to satisfy requests from applications for names.\nThe GNU libc stub resolver did not specify a source UDP port, and therefore\nused predictable port numbers. This could have made DNS spoofing attacks\neasier.\n\nThe Linux kernel has been updated to implement random UDP source ports\nwhere none are specified by an application. This allows applications, such\nas those using the GNU libc stub resolver, to use random UDP source ports,\nhelping to make DNS spoofing attacks harder.\n\n* when using certain hardware, a bug in UART_BUG_TXEN may have caused\nincorrect hardware detection, causing data flow to \"/dev/ttyS1\" to hang.\n\n* a 50-75% drop in NFS server rewrite performance, compared to Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 4.6, has been resolved.\n\n* due a bug in the fast userspace mutex code, while one thread fetched a\npointer, another thread may have removed it, causing the first thread to\nfetch the wrong pointer, possibly causing a system crash.\n\n* on certain Hitachi hardware, removing the \"uhci_hcd\" module caused a\nkernel oops, and the following error:\n\nBUG: warning at arch/ia64/kernel/iosapic.c:1001/iosapic_unregister_intr()\n\nEven after the \"uhci_hcd\" module was reloaded, there was no access to USB\ndevices. As well, on systems that have legacy interrupts,\n\"acpi_unregister_gsi\" incorrectly called \"iosapci_unregister_intr()\",\ncausing warning messages to be logged.\n\n* when a page was mapped with mmap(), and \"PROT_WRITE\" was the only\n\"prot\" argument, the first read of that page caused a segmentation fault.\nIf the page was read after it was written to, no fault occurred. This was\nincompatible with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 behavior.\n\n* due to a NULL pointer dereference in powernowk8_init(), a panic may\nhave occurred.\n\n* certain error conditions handled by the bonding sysfs interface could\nhave left rtnl_lock() unbalanced, either by locking and returning without\nunlocking, or by unlocking when it did not lock, possibly causing a\n\"kernel: RTNL: assertion failed at net/core/fib_rules.c\" error.\n\n* the kernel currently expects a maximum of six Machine Check Exception\n(MCE) banks to be exposed by a CPU. Certain CPUs have 7 or more, which may\nhave caused the MCE to be incorrectly reported.\n\n* a race condition in UNIX domain sockets may have caused recv() to return\nzero. For clusters, this may have caused unexpected failovers.\n\n* msgrcv() frequently returned an incorrect \"ERESTARTNOHAND (514)\" error\nnumber.\n\n* on certain Intel Itanium-based systems, when kdump was configured to halt\nthe system after a dump operation, after the \"System halted.\" output, the\nkernel continued to output endless \"soft lockup\" messages.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.",
