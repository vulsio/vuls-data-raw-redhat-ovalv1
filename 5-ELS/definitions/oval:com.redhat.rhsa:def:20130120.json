		"description": "The quota package provides system administration tools for monitoring\nand limiting user and group disk usage on file systems.\n\nIt was discovered that the rpc.rquotad service did not use tcp_wrappers\ncorrectly. Certain hosts access rules defined in \"/etc/hosts.allow\" and\n\"/etc/hosts.deny\" may not have been honored, possibly allowing remote\nattackers to bypass intended access restrictions. (CVE-2012-3417)\n\nThis issue was discovered by the Red Hat Security Response Team.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this update, values were not properly transported via the remote\nprocedure call (RPC) and interpreted by the client when querying the quota\nusage or limits for network-mounted file systems if the quota values were\n2^32 kilobytes or greater. As a consequence, the client reported mangled\nvalues. This update modifies the underlying code so that such values are\ncorrectly interpreted by the client. (BZ#667360)\n\n* Prior to this update, warnquota sent messages about exceeded quota limits\nfrom a valid domain name if the warnquota tool was enabled to send warning\ne-mails and the superuser did not change the default warnquota\nconfiguration. As a consequence, the recipient could reply to invalid\naddresses. This update modifies the default warnquota configuration to use\nthe reserved example.com. domain. Now, warnings about exceeded quota limits\nare sent from the reserved domain that inform the superuser to change to\nthe correct value. (BZ#680429)\n\n* Previously, quota utilities could not recognize the file system as having\nquotas enabled and refused to operate on it due to incorrect updating of\n/etc/mtab. This update prefers /proc/mounts to get a list of file systems\nwith enabled quotas. Now, quota utilities recognize file systems with\nenabled quotas as expected. (BZ#689822)\n\n* Prior to this update, the setquota(8) tool on XFS file systems failed\nto set disk limits to values greater than 2^31 kilobytes. This update\nmodifies the integer conversion in the setquota(8) tool to use a 64-bit\nvariable big enough to store such values. (BZ#831520)\n\nAll users of quota are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to resolve these issues.",
