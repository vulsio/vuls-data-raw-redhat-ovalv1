    "description": "In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy, support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 will be retired on March 31, 2017, at the end of Production Phase 3. Until that date, customers will continue to receive Critical impact security patches and selected Urgent priority bug fixes for RHEL 5.11 (the final RHEL 5 release). On that date, active support included with your RHEL Premium or Standard subscription will conclude. This means that customers will continue to have access to all previously released content. In addition, limited technical support will be available through Red Hat's Global Support Services as described in the Knowledge Base article available at https://access.redhat.com/articles/64664 (under \"non-current minor release\").\n\nHowever, we recognize that some customers will wish to remain on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 even after the March 31, 2017 retirement date. To meet this customer requirement, Red Hat will offer customers the option to purchase the Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS) Add-On as an annually renewable subscription. This ELS Add-On provides customers with up to an additional three and a half (3.5) years of Critical impact security fixes and selected Urgent priority bug fixes for RHEL 5.11. RHEL 5 ELS coverage will conclude on November 30, 2020.\n\nNote that the RHEL 5 ELS Add-On is available for the x86 (32- and 64-bit) architecture only. The RHEL 5 ELS Add-On is not available for the Itanium architecture.\n\nTo enjoy even more comprehensive product support, we encourage customers to migrate from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 to a more recent version. As a benefit of the Red Hat subscription, customers may, of course, use their active subscriptions to entitle any system on any currently supported Red Hat Enterprise Linux release.\n\nDetails of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle can be found here: \nhttps://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/",
