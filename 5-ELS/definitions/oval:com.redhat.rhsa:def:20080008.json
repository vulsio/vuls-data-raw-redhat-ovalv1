		"description": "The Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web server.\n\nA flaw was found in the mod_imagemap module. On sites where mod_imagemap\nwas enabled and an imagemap file was publicly available, a cross-site\nscripting attack was possible. (CVE-2007-5000)\n\nA flaw was found in the mod_autoindex module. On sites where directory\nlistings are used, and the \"AddDefaultCharset\" directive has been removed\nfrom the configuration, a cross-site scripting attack might have been\npossible against Web browsers which do not correctly derive the response\ncharacter set following the rules in RFC 2616. (CVE-2007-4465)\n\nA flaw was found in the mod_status module. On sites where mod_status was\nenabled and the status pages were publicly available, a cross-site\nscripting attack was possible. (CVE-2007-6388)\n\nA flaw was found in the mod_proxy_balancer module. On sites where\nmod_proxy_balancer was enabled, a cross-site scripting attack against an\nauthorized user was possible. (CVE-2007-6421)\n\nA flaw was found in the mod_proxy_balancer module. On sites where\nmod_proxy_balancer was enabled, an authorized user could send a carefully\ncrafted request that would cause the Apache child process handling that\nrequest to crash. This could lead to a denial of service if using a\nthreaded Multi-Processing Module. (CVE-2007-6422) \n\nA flaw was found in the mod_proxy_ftp module. On sites where mod_proxy_ftp\nwas enabled and a forward proxy was configured, a cross-site scripting\nattack was possible against Web browsers which do not correctly derive the\nresponse character set following the rules in RFC 2616. (CVE-2008-0005)\n\nUsers of Apache httpd should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues. Users should restart\nhttpd after installing this update.",
