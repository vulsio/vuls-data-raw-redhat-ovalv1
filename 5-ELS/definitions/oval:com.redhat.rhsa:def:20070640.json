    "description": "The Conga package is a web-based administration tool for remote cluster and\nstorage management.\n\nA flaw was found in ricci during a code audit.  A remote attacker who is\nable to connect to ricci could cause ricci to temporarily refuse additional\nconnections, a denial of service (CVE-2007-4136).\n\nFixes in this updated package include:\n\n* The nodename is now set for manual fencing.\n\n* The node log no longer displays in random order.\n\n* A bug that prevented a node from responding when a cluster was deleted is\nnow fixed.\n\n* A PAM configuration that incorrectly called the deprecated module\npam_stack was removed.\n\n* A bug that prevented some quorum disk configurations from being accepted\nis now fixed.\n\n* Setting multicast addresses now works properly.\n\n* rpm -V on luci no longer fails. \n\n* The user interface rendering time for storage interface is now faster.\n\n* An error message that incorrectly appeared when rebooting nodes during\ncluster creation was removed.\n\n* Cluster snaps configuration (an unsupported feature) has been removed\naltogether to prevent user confusion. \n\n* A user permission bug resulting from a luci code error is now fixed.\n\n* luci and ricci init script return codes are now LSB-compliant.\n\n* VG creation on cluster nodes now defaults to \"clustered\".\n\n* An SELinux AVC bug that prevented users from setting up shared storage on\nnodes is now fixed.\n\n* An access error that occurred when attempting to access a cluster node\nafter its cluster was deleted is now fixed.\n\n* IP addresses can now be used to create clusters. \n\n* Attempting to configure a fence device no longer results in an\nAttributeError.\n\n* Attempting to create a new fence device to a valid cluster no longer\nresults in a KeyError.\n\n* Several minor user interface validation errors have been fixed, such as\nenforcing cluster name length and fence port, etc.\n\n* A browser lock-up that could occur during storage configuration has been\nfixed.\n\n* Virtual service creation now works without error.\n\n* The fence_xvm tag is no longer misspelled in the cluster.conf file.\n\n* Luci failover forms are complete and working.\n* Rebooting a fresh cluster install no longer generates an error message.\n\n* A bug that prevented failed cluster services from being started is now\nfixed.\n\n* A bug that caused some cluster operations (e.g., node delete) to fail on\nclusters with mixed-cased cluster names is now fixed.\n\n* Global cluster resources can be reused when constructing cluster\nservices.\n\nEnhancements in this updated package include:\n\n* Users can now access Conga through Internet Explorer 6.\n\n* Dead nodes can now be evicted from a cluster.\n\n* Shared storage on new clusters is now enabled by default.\n\n* The fence user-interface flow is now simpler.\n\n* A port number is now shown in ricci error messages.\n\n* The kmod-gfs-xen kernel module is now installed when creating a cluster.\n\n* Cluster creation status is now shown visually.\n\n* User names are now sorted for display.\n\n* The fence_xvmd tag can now be added from the dom0 cluster nodes.\n\n* The ampersand character (&) can now be used in fence names.\n\n* All packaged files are now installed with proper owners and permissions.\n\n* New cluster node members are now properly initialized.\n\n* Storage operations can now be completed even if an LVM snapshot is present.\n\n* Users are now informed via dialog when nodes are rebooted as part of a\ncluster operation.\n\n* Failover domains are now properly listed for virtual services and\ntraditional clustered services.\n\n* Luci can now create and distribute keys for fence_xvmd.\n\nAll Conga users are advised to upgrade to this update, which applies these\nfixes and enhancements.",
