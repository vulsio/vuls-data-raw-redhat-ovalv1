		"description": "The tog-pegasus packages provide OpenPegasus Web-Based Enterprise\nManagement (WBEM) services. WBEM is a platform and resource independent\nDistributed Management Task Force (DMTF) standard that defines a common\ninformation model and communication protocol for monitoring and controlling\nresources.\n\nRed Hat defines additional security enhancements for OpenGroup Pegasus WBEM\nservices in addition to those defined by the upstream OpenGroup Pegasus\nrelease. For details regarding these enhancements, refer to the file\n\"README.RedHat.Security\", included in the Red Hat tog-pegasus package.\n\nAfter re-basing to version 2.7.0 of the OpenGroup Pegasus code, these\nadditional security enhancements were no longer being applied. As a\nconsequence, access to OpenPegasus WBEM services was not restricted to the\ndedicated users as described in README.RedHat.Security. An attacker able to\nauthenticate using a valid user account could use this flaw to send\nrequests to WBEM services. (CVE-2008-4313)\n\nNote: default SELinux policy prevents tog-pegasus from modifying system\nfiles. This flaw's impact depends on whether or not tog-pegasus is confined\nby SELinux, and on any additional CMPI providers installed and enabled on a\nparticular system.\n\nFailed authentication attempts against the OpenPegasus CIM server were not\nlogged to the system log as documented in README.RedHat.Security. An\nattacker could use this flaw to perform password guessing attacks against a\nuser account without leaving traces in the system log. (CVE-2008-4315)\n\nAll tog-pegasus users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain patches to correct these issues.",
