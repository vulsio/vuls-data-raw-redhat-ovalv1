		"description": "In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy,\nsupport for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 will be retired on March 31, 2017,\nat the end of Production Phase 3. Until that date, customers will continue\nto receive Critical impact security patches and selected urgent priority\nbug fixes for RHEL 5.11 (the final RHEL 5 release). On that date, active\nsupport included with your RHEL Premium or Standard subscription will\nconclude. This means that customers will continue to have access to all\npreviously released (RHEL 4, RHEL 5, etc.) content. In addition, limited\ntechnical support will be available through Red Hat's Global Support\nServices as described in the Knowledge Base article available at\nhttps://access.redhat.com/articles/64664 (search for \"non-current minor\nrelease\").\n\nHowever, we recognize that some customers will wish to remain on Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 5 even after the March 31, 2017 retirement date. To meet\nthis customer requirement, Red Hat will offer customers the option to\npurchase the Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS) Add-On as an annually\nrenewable subscription. This ELS Add-On provides customers with up to an\nadditional three and a half (3.5) years of Critical impact security fixes\nand selected urgent priority bug fixes for RHEL 5.11. RHEL 5 ELS coverage\nwill conclude on November 30, 2020.\n\nNote that the RHEL 5 ELS Add-On is available for the x86 (32- and 64-bit)\narchitecture only. The RHEL 5 ELS Add-On is not available for the Itanium\narchitecture.\n\nTo take advantage of a more comprehensive product support, we encourage\ncustomers to migrate from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 to a more recent\nversion. As a benefit of the Red Hat subscription, customers may use their\nactive subscriptions to entitle any system on any currently supported Red\nHat Enterprise Linux release.\n\nDetails of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle can be found here:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/site/support/policy/updates/errata/",
